					<blockquote><p>NIPAP is the most powerful open-source solution in today's IPAM landscape. NIPAP is a rare and beautiful creature in that it has full feature parity between all its northbound components across all address-families, even in VRF context! The team's modern approach to software development and their focus on long-term manageability, give me the confidence to recommend NIPAP to everyone.</p><footer>Job Snijders, Network Architect</footer></blockquote>

				<div class="col-md-6">
					<blockquote><p>We love NIPAP! We went from using a shared Google spreadsheet with very little standardization to an easy to use Web and CLI. Best of all the data is now in a uniform pattern and we can access it via a sane API. NIPAP FTW!</p><footer>Augie Schwer of Safari Books Online</footer></blockquote>

					<blockquote><p>DANTE operator of GEANT the pan European research and education network has been using NIPAP for some time now. DANTE selected NIPAP for its ability to provision subnets following predefined template for its ease of use and flexibility.  
						
						NIPAP allows DANTE's teams to work from a single tool from the definition of the addressing template to its reservation and allocation ensuring a clean and well maintained address space. This cohesive approach is all the more critical when running both IPv4 and IPv6 natively which NIPAP help to maintain. It was all also critical for DANTE to select a tool able to work with Virtual routing instances (VRF).
						NIPAP is a very simple tool, very easy to put in place it allowed DANTE to maintain a well-organized address space very cheaply and very quickly. 
						
						We would like to see the introduction of few features like the abilities to delegated part of the address space and the ability to create user groups with different responsibility of the address space. NIPAP is a "no muss, no fuss" tool very easy to deploy and DANTE will follow future development of the tool with great interest.<footer>Sebastiano Buscaglione, DANTE</footer></blockquote>
