pynipap (0.27.0-1) stable; urgency=medium

  * Fix of backend forking (#653). Now real performance boost!
  * AVP (Attribute-Value Pair) support allowing users to store custom
    attributes associated with prefixes, VRFs or pools (#394, #631,
    #629)
  * Add tags to VRFs for easy categorization and searching (#484)
  * Add tags to pools for easy categorization and searching (#566)
  * New status field for prefixes, improving the experience for registry
    type users. Status can be "assigned", "reserved" or "quarantine".
    (#494)
  * New expires field for prefixes allowing users (typically registry)
    to set an expiration time of an assignment. No actions are actually
    taken once the expiration time has passed (#599)
  * Statistics improvements for pools, now shows number of
    total/used/free prefixes as opposed to just showing it for
    addresses. The number of free prefixes is calculated based on the
    default prefix length of new prefixes assigned from the pool (#528).
  * Rewrite of parts of web-UI using AngularJS (#635, #621, #628, #638)
  * Add bootstrap CSS for easing web development. Replacement of our own
    components (like buttons) is off to a soft-start. (#543, #660)
  * Permission check of .nipaprc to prevent the world reading it (#632)
  * Fix of open file handle leaks in backend (#485)
  * Add DB version check for backend to prevent running the backend with
    the wrong database schema version.
  * Backend now ships with requirements.txt to ease running it in a
    virtualenv. Travis-CI also runs a job for testing NIPAP in a
    virtualenv.
  * Some work on being more Python 3 friendly (#596, #583, #648)
  * Fix statistics calculation bug (#590)
  * Performance improvements (#589)
  * Some documentation updates (#615)
  * Various other feature improvements and bug fixes

pynipap (0.24.0-1) stable; urgency=low

  * nipaprc configuration option 'default_vrf' is replaced by
    'default_vrf_rt' which only affects address adds/edits/removals. A
    second option 'default_list_vrf_rt' controls the default VRF for
    listing/search operations.
  * 'guest' user is no longer part of default shipping local_auth
    database. A user needs to be added manually for the web UI or CLI
    users.
  * New pre-forked backend. Replaced Twisted in preference of Flask-XML-
    RPC, served using Tornado. Backend will default to pre-forking to
    the number of CPUs. PostgreSQL also pre-forks and with one
    PostgreSQL backend per nipapd process, performance for parallel
    queries should see a significant boost.
  * Backend support for read-only users. A local_auth (SQLite) user can
    now be configured to be read-only. Web UI is lacking support, for
    example the "Add prefix" button is still present and enabled but
    trying to add a prefix will raise an error message.
  * Revamp look of VRF information and make it consistent across web UI
    and CLI as far as possible.
  * Fix for searches on "weird" IP addresses like 123.123123/24 which
    would previously generate exception.
  * Various formatting improvements to CLI
  * Various bug fixes to the web UI
  * Consistently use iprange indices in database for improved
    performance
  * Reference documentation is now kept up to date using readthedocs.org
  * Makefile target for bumping version - won't help you unless you're a
    developer ;)

pynipap (0.23.0-1) stable; urgency=low

  * Add 'Customer ID' attribute to prefixes. This can be used to store a
    customer name or an ID referencing a customer database.
  * List top level prefixes by default in Web UI instead of empty result.
  * Fix for Web UI rendering bug which led to incorrect prefixes being rendered.
  * Fix for Web UI which would not display inherited tags in prefix list.
  * The number of children (sub-prefixes) of a prefix is now precalculated and
    stored in the database. Improves user experience and somewhat the speed of
    prefix search queries.
  * Limit number of connections held open by pynipap. When doing large amounts
    of operations, such as importing data, pynipap would keep open connections
    to the backend eventually running into the limit of open connections of the
    backend. pynipap no longer keeps open connections for any extended period of
    time.
  * Fix for backend returning too many "context prefixes" on prefix search even
    when asked not to.
  * Some improved error handling for AJAX calls.

pynipap (0.22.0-1) precise; urgency=low

  * Add support for Tags. Prefixes can be tagged with a tag for easier searching
    and categorisation of prefixes.
  * Add VLAN attributes to prefixes. There are no constraints on the VLAN
    attribute apart from being an integer.
  * The Web UI now displays "top level" prefixes on empty search. This means it
    is typically easier to get an overview of addresses.
  * CLI automatically adjusts column width for better rendering of wide
    prefixes, ie typically IPv6.
  * CLI tab completion has been fixed for entries needing escaping (such as
    those containing a space).
  * Web UI has improved support for going back & forward in prefix list.
  * Bug fix to 'nipap address view' which could previously display the wrong
    prefix under certain conditions.
  * Add timestamp value for when prefix was added and last modified. These
    values are available over the XML-RPC API and can be used as a filter to
    only get prefixes modified since timestamp X which could ease integration
    with external systems which need to stay in sync with NIPAP.
  * Fix in debian/postinst to make www user trusted on install.
  * Improve defaults in .nipaprc skeleton file.
  * Various internal small fixes / refactoring.

pynipap (0.21.0-1) precise; urgency=low

  * CLI now supports pool resizing, ie growing or shrinking a pool by the
    addition or removal of member prefixes. Code by Kai Storbeck <kai@xs4all.nl>
  * Improve prefix smart search on addresses. The smart search for prefixes has
    been modified so that IP addresses are matched with a
    contains-or-equals-operator instead of just equals. Searching on an address
    (e.g. 1.3.3.1) will thus return covering prefixes, such as 1.3.3.0/24 even
    if 1.3.3.1 does not exist. This is great for searching on addresses and
    getting the best matches even if there is no exact match.
  * Fix Bash tab completion
  * Fix bug in find_free_prefix method in XML-RPC API, thanks to Thomas Menari
    <t@menari.eu>
  * Fix CLI with regard to order_id argument to prefixes, thanks to GitHub user
    dosomder
  * Fix rendering bug in web UI
  * There is now a small unit test for the CLI

pynipap (0.20.0-1) precise; urgency=low

  * For Debian, nipapd now runs per default as the nipap user which
    allows nipapd to connect to PostgreSQL via a UNIX socket instead of over
    TCP. This means the installation is now truly zero touch as the postgres
    configuration does not need to be modified.
  * For Debian the pid file location has moved
  * nipapd supports dropping privileges to a non-root user
  * Fix for incorrect Web UI prefix rendering that would not display all
    prefixes or break the collapse functionality
  * Fix logging in nipapd for certain SQL queries
  * Added prefix help on more pages in the web UI
  * Fix for VRF tab completion

  * Improve Debian packaging to help user automatically setup NIPAP by loading
    database structure and creating needed users automatically - zero touch setup
