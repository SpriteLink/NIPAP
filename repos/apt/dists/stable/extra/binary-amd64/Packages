Description: IPv4 and IPv4 range index types for PostgreSQL 8.4
 This PostgreSQL module provides two data types, ip4 and ip4r, which can
 contain a single IPv4 address or a range of IPv4 addresses,
 respectively.
 .
 While PostgreSQL already has built-in types 'inet' and 'cidr', the
 authors of this module found that they had a number of requirements
 that were not addressed by the built-in type.
 .
 Firstly and most importantly, the built-in types have no support for
 index lookups of the form (column >>= parameter), i.e. where you have
 a table of IP address ranges and wish to find which ones include a
 given IP address.  This requires an rtree or gist index to do
 efficiently, and also requires a way to represent IP address ranges
 that do not fall precisely on CIDR boundaries.
 .
 Secondly, the built-in inet/cidr are somewhat overloaded with
 semantics, with inet combining two distinct concepts (a netblock, and
 a specific IP within that netblock). Furthermore, they are variable
 length types (to support IPv6) with non-trivial overheads, and the
 authors (whose applications mainly deal in large volumes of single
 IPv4 addresses) wanted a more lightweight representation.
 .
 ip4r therefore supports two distinct data types (so far):
 .
   ip4   - a single IPv4 address
   ip4r  - an arbitrary range of IPv4 addresses

Description: IPv4 and IPv6 types for PostgreSQL 9.1
 This PostgreSQL module provides several data types which can contain
 single IPv4 or IPv6 addresses or a range of such addresses.
 .
 ip4r supports these data types:
 .
  ip4:       IPv4 address '#.#.#.#'
  ip4r:      IPv4 range '#.#.#.#-#.#.#.#' or '#.#.#.#/#' or '#.#.#.#'
  ip6:       IPv6 address 'xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx'
  ip6r:      IPv6 range '#-#' or '#/#' or '#'
  ipaddress: IPv4 or IPv6 address
  iprange:   IPv4 or IPv6 range
 .
 While PostgreSQL already has built-in types 'inet' and 'cidr', the
 authors of this module found that they had a number of requirements
 that were not addressed by the built-in types.
