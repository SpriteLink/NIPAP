# -------------------------
# NIPAP configuration file
# -------------------------
#
# This configuration file contains information regarding both the NIPAPd
# backend daemon as well as the web front-end, ie it is a shared configuration
# file.
#
# This file consists mostly of lines of the form:
#
#   name = value
#
# Where name is the name of an option and value is its value. Value may be
# empty. Options are further grouped into sections, which start with:
#
#   [section]
#
# There is no explicit marker for the end of a section. All options following a
# section header is interpreted as belonging to that section. Please be aware
# of which section you edit.
#
# Lines starting with "#" or ";" are interpreted as a comments. It may not
# contain leading whitespace! Comments may also appear on lines holding values
# or section names but must be prefaced with whitespace followed by ";". Lines
# starting with whitespace is interpreted as a continuation of the value on the
# previous option-value line.
#
# The commented-out settings shown represent the default values in most cases.
#
# This file is read on server startup and in case of NIPAPd when the NIPAPd
# process receives a SIGHUP signal - do note however that certain changes
# requires a server restart and not just a configuration file reload.
#

#
# Options regarding the NIPAP daemon
# ----------------------------------
#
[nipapd]

# Run nipapd as a different user, ie drop privileges from root to the specified
# user and group. If no user is specified, nipapd will run as the user who
# started it (typically root). If only user but no group is specified, the
# value for user will be used for group as well.
#user = nipap
#group = nipap


listen = 127.0.0.1              ; IP address to listen on.
# The default is to listen to 127.0.0.1. Use 0.0.0.0 to listen on all addresses
# (change requires restart).
port = 1337                     ; XML-RPC listen port (change requires restart)

foreground = false              ; run in foreground, won't work with init script

#
# - Database Connection -
#
# the following parameters control how NIPAPd connects to the PostgreSQL
# backend database
#

db_host = localhost            ; database hostname
# The default is to connect via IP to localhost. This is preferred over
# connecting over a UNIX socket as it supports MD5 authentication.
# "" (ie, empty string without quotes), is a special case which means to
# connect over a UNIX socket but be aware that authentication needs to be done
# using "ident" support so the user nipapd is run as needs to match with the
# database username.

db_port = 5432                  ; port that PostgreSQL listens to, defaults to
# 5432, only applicable if connection is not over a UNIX socket

db_name = nipap                 ; database name
db_user = nipap                 ; database username
db_pass = papin                 ; database password

db_sslmode = require            ; database SSL mode
# please see the PostgreSQL database documentation for further details



#
# Options regarding the authentication backend
# --------------------------------------------
#
[auth]
default_backend = local                ; which backend to use by default
auth_cache_timeout = 3600              ; seconds cached auth entries are stored

# example backend with SQLite
[auth.backends.local]
type = SqliteAuth

db_path = /etc/nipap/local_auth.db     ; path to SQLite database used

# example backend for LDAP
#[auth.backends.ldap1]
#type = LdapAuth
#
#basedn = dc=test,dc=com                ; base DN
#uri = ldaps://ldap.test.com            ; LDAP server URI

#
# Options for the WWW UI
# ----------------------
#
[www]
xmlrpc_uri = http://@:@127.0.0.1:1337
#connection uri to the backend
#example using local authentication with username 'user' and password 'pass'
#xmlrpc_uri = http://user@local:pass@127.0.0.1:1337

# welcome_message allows the display of a custom message on the login page of
# the web interface, it might contain hints about what credentials to use or
# just greet the user.
#welcome_message = Welcome to NIPAP at COMPANY. Please login using your XYZ credentials.
