NIPAP release handling
======================
This document tries to describe most aspects of the release handling of NIPAP.

Packaging
---------
NIPAP is packaged into a number of packages. There is the backend parts in form
of the NIPAP XML-RPC daemon (hereinafter referred to as nipapd) that is just
the actual daemon. Since it depends on PostgreSQL it has its own package while
most of its actual code lies in the shared 'nipap' Python module which is
packaged into nipap-common. The same Python module is used by the web frontend
and it is for this reason it is packaged into the nipap-common package. nipapd
and nipap-common share a common source directory (nipap) and thus also share
version number.

The client library/module in pynipap is packaged into a package with the same
name and has its own version number, ie it is not correlated in any way with
the version of the backend parts.


Version numbering
-----------------
Version numbering of NIPAP is in the form of major.minor.patch. Major releases
are milestones for when a number of large improvements have been implemented
and are stable while minor releases will increment for most new features. Patch
releases will only include smaller bug fixes or other similarily small changes.

Major releases should generally be released after a number of features have
proven to be stable and fairly bug free. For example, we are at 1.0.0. A couple
of features are implemented over a period of time and for each, a new minor
version is released so we are now at 1.7.0. After some time in production and
seeing that these features behave as expect it, version 2.0.0 can be released
as a "trusted release" with basically the same feature set as 1.7.0 but now
marked as a stable and major version.

This implies that major version can be trusted, while the risk for bugs are
higher in minor versions and again smaller with patch releases.


Debian repository
-----------------
The repo itself is hosted by GitHub through their support for building a
webpage via the branch gh-pages, please see http://help.github.com/pages/ for
more information on that.

The Makefile includes a two targets (debrepo-testing & debrepo-stable) to build
the necessary files for a debian repo and put this in the correct place. As
soon as a commit is pushed, github will copy the files and produce a webpage
accessible via http://<github user>.github.com/<project name> (ie
http://spritelink.github.io/NIPAP). We use this to build a simple apt
repository hosted on GitHub.

To update the apt repo, build the debian packages, then run 'make
debrepo-testing' in the project root. This will put the packages in the testing
repo. Commit to the gh-pages branch and then push and it should all work! :)
Once a version is considered stable, run 'make debrepo-stable' to copy the
packages from the testing branch into stable. Again, commit to gh-pages and so
forth. Please see "Rolling the deb repo" section for more details.


NEWS / Changelog
----------------
There is a NEWS file outlining the differences with every version. It can
either be updated as changes are made or just before a new release is rolled by
going through the git log since the last version and making sure everything
worth mentioning is in the NEWS file.

Note how a NEWS file is usually used to document changes between versions of a
package while a Changelog file is used to convey information about changes
between commits. The Debian changelog included with packages normally do not
follow this "changelog principle" but rather they are usually used to document
changes to the actual packaging or to patches and changes made by the
maintainer of a package.

As documented on http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/footnotes.html#f16, it
is under certain circumstances perfectly fine to essentially have the same file
as Debian changelog and the project "changelog" (or NEWS file as is more correct).
One such instance is when the Debian package closely follows the project, as is
the case with NIPAP. Thus, the NEWS file will be very similar to the Debian
changelog.

Debian style package managers are able to fetch the Debian changelog file from
repositories and can thus display the changes between versions before
installing a package.

Build prerequisites
-------------------
Install the following debian packages::

    apt-get install debhelper python-docutils python-setuptools python3-all \
            python3-docutils python3-setuptools reprepro

Rolling a new version
---------------------
Update the NEWS file as described above.

If you have changes to the database, don't forget to increment the version
number in sql/ip_net.sql.

From the project root, run::
    make bumpversion

This will automatically update the debian changelog based on the content of the
NEWS file. You can bump the version for a single component (such as pynipap) by
running the same command in the directory of that component.

After having built packages for the new version, tag the git repo with the new
version number::
    git tag vX.Y.Z
And for pushing to git::
    git push origin refs/tags/vX.Y.Z


Rolling the deb repo
--------------------
Debian stable is the primary production platform targeted by NIPAP and new
releases should be put in our Debian repo.

To update the deb repo, make sure you are on branch 'master' and then build the
bebian packages with::
    make builddeb

Then checkout the 'gh-pages' branch and add them to the repo::
    git checkout gh-pages

Start by adding the packages the testing repo::
    make debrepo-testing

Once the new version has been tested out for a bit, it is time to copy it to
stable, using::
    make debrepo-stable

Regardless if you are putting the packages in testing or stable, you need to
actually push them to the github repo. Make sure the new files are added to
git, commit and push::
    git add --all repos
    git commit -a -m "Add nipapd vX.Y.Z to debian STABLE|TESTING repo"
    git push

Once a stable version is release, update readthedocs.org to point to the latest
tag and write a post on Google+ in the NIPAP community and share it from the
NIPAP account.


Uploading to PyPi
-----------------
pynipap should be available on PyPi::
    cd pynipap
    python setup.py sdist upload


Manually rolling a new version
------------------------------
You probably don't want to roll a new release manually but this might help in
understanding what happens behind the scenes.

The different packages are first built as Python easy_install / distutils
packages which are later mangled into a debian package. To roll a new version
there are thus two places that need updating; the first is where easy_install
gets its version number. You can look into setup.py and see the version line
and which file & variable it refers too.

See the following files for version info:
nipap/nipap/__init__.py
pynipap/pynipap.py
nipap-cli/nipap_cli/__init__.py
nipap-www/nipapwww/__init__.py

To roll a new release, update the Python file with the new version number
according to the above instructions. After that, run 'dch -v <version>', where
version is the version number previously entered into the Python file postfixed
with -1. Ie, if you want to release 1.0.0, set that in the Python file and use
1.0.0-1 for dch. The -1 is the version of the debian package for non-native
packages. Non-native packages are all packages that are not exlusively packaged
for debian. If you want to release a new debian release, for example if you
made changes to the actual packaging but not the source of the project, just
increment the -x number.

When dch launches an editor for editing the changelog. Copy the content of the
NEWS file into the Debian changelog (see previous chapten "NEWS / Changelog"
for more information). Make sure the formatting aligns and save the file.
