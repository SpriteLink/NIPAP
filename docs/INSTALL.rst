Installation of NIPAP
=====================
NIPAP is officially supported on Debian and Debian derivatives. This includes
pre-built packages, an automated installation (using Debians post-installation
script) and above all, that it is tested.

Installation
------------
If you are running a Debian system or a Debian derivative, see
`installing on Debian <install-debian.rst>`_ for instructions.

NIPAP should be able to run on any Unix-like operating system but you will need
to install dependencies and NIPAP manually. See `installing on Unix systems
<install-unix.rst>`_ for instructions.

Configuration
-------------
Once you have NIPAP installed on your machine, read `nipap configuration
<config-nipapd.rst>`_ for a configuration guide of the NIPAP backend (nipapd).

Check out `CLI configuration <config-cli.rst>`_ and / or `configuration of
nipap-www <config-www.rst>`_ which covers the necessary configuration for
setting up the NIPAP web UI.
