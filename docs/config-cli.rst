CLI configuration
-----------------
Once you have the nipap-cli package installed (or if you've installed the CLI
manually), a new command, 'nipap', is available to you. It reads .nipaprc in
your home directory and expects to find things like the host address of nipapd
and authentication credentials.

If you haven't already done so, you can create a new user so that you can
authenticate against nipapd. Execute the following on the machine running
nipapd to create a new user in the local authentication database::

    nipap-passwd -a *username* -p *username* -n "My CLI user"

Where *username* and *password* is the username and password you wish to
create. Use the same username and password to fill in your .nipaprc. Here's an
example .nipaprc that will work towards localhost with the user you just
created (also see nipap-cli/nipaprc for a more complete example)::

    [global]
    hostname = localhost
    port     = 1337
    username = *username*
    password = *password*
    default_vrf_rt = none
    default_list_vrf_rt = all

Naturally, if you are running the CLI and nipapd on two different machines,
'hostname' will need to be set to the machine where nipapd is running.
Furthermore you can remove the 'password' line if you prefer to be asked for
your password every time.

'default_vrf_rt' specifies the RT of the VRF used as default by 'nipap address
add/modify/remove/view' commands when no other VRF RT is explicitly specified
on the command line. It is also used as default VRF when expanding a pool with
a new prefix for the first time. 'nona' or '-' means VRF 'Default' (RT: -)

'default_list_vrf_rt' is used by 'nipap address list' which per default will
search in the following VRF RT when no VRF RT is explicitly specified on the
command line.  'all' means that searches will include results from all VRFs.

Let's try adding a prefix too::

    nipap address add prefix 192.0.2.0/24 type assignment description "test prefix"

And list everything covered by 0.0.0.0/0::

    nipap address list 0/0
