nipap-whoisd - the NIPAP whois daemon
=====================================
The NIPAP whois daemon provides a whois-style interface for quering data in the
NIPAP database. It receives whois queries, translates these into search queries
towards the nipapd backend and sends the result, with a whois style format,
back to the client.
